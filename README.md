# profilescroller
A profile scrolling web page component built with javascript

Hi, welcome to my profile scrolling component, i built this with the intention to use it when fetching data from an api. the profile examples are hardcoded, to use with an fetch api all you need to do is pass the data object into the function (profileIterator) instead of my hardcode and adjust the innerhtml to suit your key-pair values.

Feel free to use it in your own projects.
